## About

Dissensus AI investigates stability, alignment, and friction dynamics in complex adversarial systems. The lab's research programme spans computational finance, political economy, AI alignment, and formal methods, with 25+ publications to date.

Each paper is a proof-of-concept for a different application domain -- political governance, financial markets, developmental psychology, AI alignment -- unified by the study of how competing interests generate structural conflict.
